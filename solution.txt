hello the correct name and password need to satisfy next requierments
1)the length need to be at least 5 characters of the name and of the password(the progrma doesnt check if they bouth the same length but its will not pass the check password function if not)
2)the name contains only capital letters
3)the password can be digits or capital letters or both for every letter in name its one digit or letter in password
example the name AAACD so the correct password can be 00023 or 02300 or 0AA32 the order of password doesnt matter 
its even can be the same as name every letter in name can be a digit in password but only from A-J because after J
there is no digit that after because the last digit its 9 and there is no digit for the tens or elevens letter etc
